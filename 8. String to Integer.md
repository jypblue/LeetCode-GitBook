>Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.
><strong>Hint: </strong>Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

><strong>Notes: </strong>It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

><strong>Requirements for atoi:</strong>
>The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

>The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

>If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

>If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.
